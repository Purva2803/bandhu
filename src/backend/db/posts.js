Then, a simple stacking technique and some kneading results in a rich cookie dough that's marbled with color throughout. Freezing the cookies before baking is key to avoid spreading, so be patient. If you'd like, have fun with different colors of sanding sugar for the sparkle element or experiment with other colors for the marbled look.",

      "Watermelon is made up of mostly—you guess it—water, about 90 percent to be exact, which makes it a refreshing and hydrating treat. One serving of watermelon or about two cups of diced melon contains just 80 calories and 21 grams of carbohydrate. While it does contain sugar (about 17 grams), this sugar, fructose, is naturally found in fruit which makes it a far better option than added or processed sugars as it’s easier for our bodies to process and won’t spike your blood sugar as drastically as a bag of sour watermelon candy, for example. The juicy fruit is also loaded with vitamins A, B6, and C, which boost your immunity, and potassium, which can potentially help ward off muscle cramps.",
